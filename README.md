# CryptoClustering
The CryptoClustering project aims to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes using unsupervised machine learning techniques, specifically K-means clustering. Additionally, the project explores the impact of dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on clustering.


## Installation and Run Instructions:
You may need to install the **scikit-learn** and **hvPlot** packages before commencing:

### scikit-learn:
1. Open **Gitbash** and activate your virtual environment.
2. Run **conda list scikit-learn**. If the response includes a version number for scikit-learn, then the library is already installed and you can safely skip the following steps. Otherwise:
3. Run **pip install scikit-learn** in the terminal.
4. Confirm installation by running **pip show scikit-learn**.

### hvplot:
1. Open **Gitbash** and activate your virtual environment.
2. Run **conda list hvplot**. If the response includes a version number for hvplot, then hvplot is already installed and you can safely skip the following steps. Otherwise:
3. Run **conda install -c pyviz hvplot** in the terminal.
4. Confirm installation by running **conda list hvplot**.
